  - I want to be able to update tasks (set it to complete, rename, reschedule)
  - I want to receive notifications/reminders of tasks
  - I want to live in a peaceful and wholesome home

2. Minimal set of features (MVP)

  - Making a group
  - Adding people to it
  - Task creation

  - Integrating with Google Calendar
  - Reports
    - weekly/monthly basis
    - Who’s the best/worst contributor?
  - Split bills
      - Dept statement?
  - Multiple groups
  - Block out times that are “unavailable” for tasks 
  - Edit / Not completed history 

4. Non-functional requirements
